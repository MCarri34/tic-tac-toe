# Design Process
I built this project by following the provided instuctions on `TicTacToe.cpp` and focusing on getting the Tic Tac Toe game working step by step. I asked the professor on Discord whether we were supposed to use the older or newer version of `Application.cpp` so I knew where to put my functional Logger code.Transfering the Logger code was confusing since I didn't realize I needed to put it above the TicTacToe code that was in the newer one. While working on `TicTacToe.cpp`, I ran into a bug where only O’s were being placed, so I had a friend look over the file and help me fix it. This project was made on **Windows**.
